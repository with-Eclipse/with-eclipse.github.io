The intro is out-dated (welcome to [Edit this page](https://github.com/with-Eclipse/with-eclipse.github.io/edit/master/index.md)), while the plugins list below is being kept updated while new arrive.

### Eclipse

Eclipse is maybe "the least known" IDE. Given the number of [projects](https://projects.eclipse.org/list-of-projects),
 modules, and Eclipse IDE distributions
 (from eclipse.org and other vendors) and no company promoting basic its usage, new user may feel little support
 or hard to find easy to follow path. Making complex thing (that software development is) to appear simple is
 [an art](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).
 However learning Eclipse IDE basics will give skill set and knowledge that can be applied
 in [wide range of Eclipse based products and IDEs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Eclipse-based_software).

### Eclipse IDE user voice

Unofficial [[yet](http://eclipse-ide.uservoice.com/forums/237853-eclipse-ide-ideas/suggestions/5380278)] wishlist
and feature request board for Eclipse IDE is at  
[http://eclipse-ide.uservoice.com/][1]

Let everybody know what you miss, want and long for.

#### Making wishes

Special with-Eclipse logo `with-eclipse-1.jpg` to start wishlist on uservoice.com

![with-eclipse-1.jpg](with-eclipse-1.jpg)

Of course it won't be immediate fulfillment. And you should raise a issue in [Bugzlilla](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/),
 as it is still official way for submitting bugs and feature requests.
These are wishes of broader community. So be more generic. [What will be useful for everybody?][1]

Vote on existing ideas. Those getting more upvotes will be seen by everybody, and popularity will speed up the implementation. 

### Story

When reading [2013 Annual Eclipse Community Report](http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/reports/annual_report.php)
and [Results of Eclipse Community Survey 2013](http://eclipse.org/org/press-release/20130612_eclipsesurvey2013.php),
 that are both interesting, a thought came that there is not Eclipse Users Community cared by Eclipse.
 
There has always been confusion with Eclipse & Eclipse platform, and are Eclipse users the users or the developers.

The problem may have been just in words. Eclipse users can refer to both platform developers
and developers who just use Eclipse, for example for web projects that prevail now.

#### Stoty update

[Artcle by Chris Mayer gives some interpretation of 2013 Survey ](http://jaxenter.com/eclipse-popularity-dips-after-juno-4-2-platform-release-survey-finds-47366.html)

[New 2014 Survey](https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/eclipsecommunity2014) results will be later.

But newer http://eclipse.org website is going to be quite different experience and focus.

### Words

If you develop something on Eclipse platform, you are Eclipse [platform] developer.  
If you develop using Eclipse, you are Java (PHP, C++, web ...etc ) developer using/with Eclipse.

### With Eclipse

While "using Eclipse" and "with Eclipse" both can do in this lines, "with Eclipse" can also imply other meaning like
"being with Eclipse". It is community of Eclipse users, that is maybe a bit overlooked by Eclipse.

Starting a community over some idea is not one person deal. Add your thoughts, ideas on <http://with-eclipse.github.io/> site.

Discuss and share links.

### Developed with Eclipse

A good idea is just add icon to your project, that proudly says "Developed with Eclipse"

<a href="http://with-eclipse.github.io/"><img alt="with-Eclipse logo" src="http://with-eclipse.github.io/with-eclipse-0.jpg" /></a>

Just use code snippet below:
