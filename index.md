### Intro

When reading [2013 Annual Eclipse Community Report](http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/reports/annual_report.php)
and [Results of Eclipse Community Survey 2013](http://eclipse.org/org/press-release/20130612_eclipsesurvey2013.php),
 that are both interesting, a thought came that there is not Eclipse Users Community cared by Eclipse.
 
There has always been confusion with Eclipse & Eclipse platform, and are Eclipse users the users or the developers.

The answer is 

### With Eclipse

If you develop something on Eclipse platform, you are Eclipse [platform] developer.  
If you develop using Eclipse, you are Java (PHP, C++, web ...etc ) developer using Eclipse.
