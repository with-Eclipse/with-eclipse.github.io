### Intro

When reading [2013 Annual Eclipse Community Report](http://www.eclipse.org/org/foundation/reports/annual_report.php)
and [Results of Eclipse Community Survey 2013](http://eclipse.org/org/press-release/20130612_eclipsesurvey2013.php),
 that are both interesting, a thought came that there is not Eclipse Users Community cared by Eclipse.
 
There has always been confusion with Eclipse & Eclipse platform, and are Eclipse users the users or the developers.

The problem may have been just in words. Eclipse users can refer to both platform developers
and developers who just use Eclipse, for example for web projects that prevail now.

### Words

If you develop something on Eclipse platform, you are Eclipse [platform] developer.  
If you develop using Eclipse, you are Java (PHP, C++, web ...etc ) developer using/with Eclipse.

### With Eclipse

While "using Eclipse" and "with Eclipse" both can do in this lines, "with Eclipse" can also imply other meaning like
"being with Eclipse". It is community of Eclipse users, that is maybe a bit overlooked by Eclipse.

Starting a community over some idea is not one person deal. Add your thoughts, ideas on <http://with-eclipse.github.io/> site.

Discuss and share links.

### Developed with Eclipse

A good idea is just add icon to your project, that proudly says "Developed with Eclipse"

### Dicussions

<div id="disqus_thread"></div>
<script type="text/javascript">
    /* * * CONFIGURATION VARIABLES: EDIT BEFORE PASTING INTO YOUR WEBPAGE * * */
    var disqus_shortname = 'with-eclipse'; // required: replace example with your forum shortname

    /* * * DON'T EDIT BELOW THIS LINE * * */
    (function() {
        var dsq = document.createElement('script'); dsq.type = 'text/javascript'; dsq.async = true;
        dsq.src = '//' + disqus_shortname + '.disqus.com/embed.js';
        (document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0] || document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0]).appendChild(dsq);
    })();
